# OpenAIClient
This GitHub project is an OpenAI client written in C#. It utilizes the OpenAI API to generate completions for a given prompt using the specified model and parameters.

The user interface includes input fields to enter your OpenAI API key, the model you want to use, the prompt you want to generate completions for, the maximum number of tokens you want the completion to have, and the temperature for the completion.  

It can save the completion context and use it in future requests allowing the user to continue a conversation with the model, where the previous response is used as the context for the following prompt.  

In summary, this GitHub project is a simple yet powerful OpenAI client, allowing users to quickly generate completions for a given prompt and use the completion context in future requests. It is built on top of the .NET framework, making it easy for developers familiar with C# and the Windows ecosystem to use and understand..
